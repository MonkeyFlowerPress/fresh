## The Pressers

**Karen** likes to read, write, and travel a lot.

**Isabela** is—among other things—a writer of lists, adorer of stories, gatherer of her cat’s whiskers, and questioner of where all the dust bunnies in her room keep coming from.

**Cate** steps into situations with a curious attitude and generous heart.
