# Monkey Flower Press

- Matches (2023) - Isabela and Karen are currently collaborating on this incendiary project.
- Plants and Pollinators Garden Map (2023) - Karen held a garden party and Isabela suggested and created an [illustrated map and key](garden-map_v1.pdf) for guests to enjoy. There is also a [flip side](garden-convo.pdf) with an imagined conversation.
- Monkey Flower Poem (2021-2022) - Our founding collaboration took a variety of forms, including a [bookmark](bookmark-stack.jpeg), zine and [full page art submission](mfp_fullpage_monkeyflower_v4.pdf) for the Theodore Payne Native Plant Garden Tour Guide. You may happen upon a [bookmark](bookmark_back.jpg) inside select titles at the San Luis Obispo Public Library. 

## The Slow Pressers

[**Karen**](karen-photo.jpg) enjoys her habitat garden. She also reads, writes, dances and travels.

[**Isabela**](isabela-photo.jpeg) is—among other things—a writer of lists, adorer of stories, gatherer of her cat’s whiskers, and questioner of where all the dust bunnies in her room keep coming from.

[**Cate**](cate-photo.jpeg) steps into situations with a curious attitude and generous heart.
